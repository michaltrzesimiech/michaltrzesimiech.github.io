I'm an organizer of Effective Altruism, a research project and a global movement using evidence and systematic reasoning to come up with the most cost-effective ways to improve the world.

I work as a Co-Founder of the <a href="https://policyentrepreneurs.org/" target="_blank">Policy Entrepreneurship Network</a>, where I design and conduct experiments to spot outlier opportunities in the space of health policy in low and middle-income countries.

My particular interest is in applications of machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) in the evaluation of policy action.

Formerly, I worked on financial regulation as a technologist at UBS and Goldman Sachs.
